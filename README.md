# Frontend Take Home Project

## Task

One of Coterie’s core frontend projects is our insurance quote flow
([https://quote.coterieinsurance.com](https://quote.coterieinsurance.com/)).
You’ll create an abbreviated quote flow that collects some information from the
user and shows them what types of insurance they might qualify for. The feature
requirements and tech stack are listed below. If something isn’t explicitly
listed you can choose how you want to handle it (e.g. styling - you could use
Styled Components, Bootstrap, Sass, etc.). If you have any questions or are
unsure about something don’t hesitate to contact Jessica Fane
([jessica@coterieinsurance.com](mailto:jessica@coterieinsurance.com)).

## Tech Stack

Use the following JS packages to make the app

- React (Create React App) - https://create-react-app.dev/
- Redux (Redux Toolkit) - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
- Unit tests (React Testing Library or similar) - https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/

Other packages/tools may be used for styling, routing, testing, etc. Please do
not use any other React boilerplates or code generators (aside from Create React
App). Those can help get projects going quickly, but we want to see how you
write clean code and solve problems - we realize this means you might have a
less thorough solution, and that's OK. You can have a list of "if I had more
time I would have added XYZ".

## Requirements

- Inputs to collect the following information about the user's business
    - Business name (string)
    - Industry
        - The interface should present the string description for the user to
          choose an option but the data sent to the server as the `industryId`
          should be the id (see the example POST body below)
        - 10537 - Plumber
        - 10391 - Software developer
        - 10415 - Lawyer
        - 10109 - Handyman
    - Email (string)
    - Annual sales (integer with these options: $50k, $75k, $100k, $150k, $200k)
    - Annual payroll (integer with these options: $50k, $75k, $100k, $150k, $200k)
    - Number of employees (integer)
    - Zip code (string)
        - This will need to sent in an object that is in a `locations` array (see example POST body below)

- The input fields should be split up over at least two pages (you can choose
  how to break them up and how to handle routing)
- After collecting the information from the user you will `POST` it to our
  Create Application endpoint:
    - [`https://api-sandbox.coterieinsurance.com/v1/commercial/applications`](https://api-sandbox.coterieinsurance.com/v1/commercial/applications)
- All API calls should include this Authorization header:
    - `authorization: token 73920c6f-d530-419c-87b3-4f4762e05e9d`
- The response will include an `availablePolicyTypes` array (see example
  response below) that indicates the types of policies that the user is eligible
  for. The final screen should show the user these options based on the API
  response.
    - GL === "General Liability"
    - PL === "Professional Liability"
    - BOP === "Business Owners Policy"
- Use git and GitHub for version control. Create a new GitHub repo for your
  project named `{first name}-{last name}-fe-takehome` and share it with Kurt
  DiPaolo ([kurt@coterieinsurance.com](mailto:kurt@coterieinsurance.com))
  `kdipaolo` and Jon Prell
  ([jon@coterieinsurance.com](mailto:jon@coterieinsurance.com))  `JTP709` on
  GitHub
- **Have fun!** We're interested in seeing how you approach the challenge and
  how you solve problems with code. The goal is for you to be successful, so if
  you have any questions or something doesn't seem clear don't hesitate to ask.
  Asking questions and seeking clarification isn't a negative indicator about your
  skills - it shows you care and that you want to do well. Asking questions is
  *always* encouraged at Coterie, and our hiring process is no different.

## What to expect next 
- A pairing session with one of our front end developers where you'll work
  together to add a feature.
- In the panel interview, be prepared to run the application locally, walk
  through the UI, and share your code with us.
